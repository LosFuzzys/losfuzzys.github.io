<h3>LosFuzzys’ Manifesto</h3>

<p><em>LosFuzzys</em> is a group of people interested in information security, which occasionally participates in CTFs. (<a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">What is CTF?</a>)</p>

<p>Our motivation is our interest in information security, and technology in general. We love challenges and CTFs provide a great way of practising information security related skills and also team-work in diverse teams. CTFs are collaborative and competitive at the same time and most importantly, they are fun.</p>

<p><em>LosFuzzys</em> welcomes people with different skill levels; a curious beginner is as much welcome as an experienced person. We also embrace different skill sets and diverse backgrounds.</p>

<ul>
<li>We believe in information sharing and open knowledge, in a responsible way.</li>
<li>We believe in privacy and respect the privacy of others.</li>
<li>We as a team do neither take part in nor endorse unlawful activities.</li>
<li>We think learning about attacks is essential to learning defensive skills.</li>
<li>We do not attack people outside of educational settings or competitions.</li>
<li>We do not use the skills we learn during our training and competitions to do any harm.</li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr; don’t be eve.</p>
<p>And (don’t) feed the bugs (except delicious stacktraces)!</p>
