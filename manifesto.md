*LosFuzzys* is a group of people interested in information security, which occasionally participates in CTFs. ([What is CTF?](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/))

Our motivation is our interest in information security, and technology in general. We love challenges and CTFs provide a great way of practising information security related skills and also team-work in diverse teams. CTFs are collaborative and competitive at the same time and most importantly, they are fun.

*LosFuzzys* welcomes people with different skill levels; a curious beginner is as much welcome as an experienced person. We also embrace different skill sets and diverse backgrounds.

* We believe in information sharing and open knowledge, in a responsible way.
* We believe in privacy and respect the privacy of others.
* We as a team do neither take part in nor endorse unlawful activities.
* We think learning about attacks is essential to learning defensive skills.
* We do not attack people outside of educational settings or competitions.
* We do not use the skills we learn during our training and competitions to do any harm.

tl;dr; don’t be eve.

And (don’t) feed the bugs (except delicious stacktraces)!
