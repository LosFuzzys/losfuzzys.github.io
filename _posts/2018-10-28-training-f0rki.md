Some of you might know him, others don't: [Michael Rodler](https://www.syssec.wiwi.uni-due.de/team/michael-rodler/), alias [f0rki](https://f0rki.at/), is one of the people who started LosFuzzys back in 2014.

Last year he moved on to pursue his PhD at Uni Duisburg-Essen.
But now he is back - if only for a brief moment - and a special training.

What's the topic of the training? You might have guessed it:  
**Binary Pwning Schmankerl**!

* **When?** Sunday (28. October), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! just come! (bring a laptop)


See you there!

PS: After the training, we plan to meet up for a beer or two (probably at Moxx, Moserhofgasse).
