In the first week of September this year, the second [*Security Week Graz*](https://www.securityweek.at/) took place in our neighborhood. One event hosted during the week was the *Summers School* on *Security & Correctness in the Internet of Things*. To challenge the students at the summer school (and those participating remote), [someone](https://twitter.com/misc0110) organized a small but very nice CTF.

Guess who won?

(You can read some **Writeups** about the challenges we solved on our [Writeup page](https://hack.more.systems/writeups/).)
