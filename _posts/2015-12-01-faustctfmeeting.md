FaustCTF, another offence&defence CTF, is happening on the 18th of December (Friday before the Christmas break) and we are going to participate!

For that we scheduled two events:

- Thu 2015-12-17, 17:00 to 20:00, FaustCTF preparation meeting (+ $tool workshop?)
- Fri 2015-12-18, 10:00 to 24:00, FaustCTF
(FaustCTF itself will start at 17:00)

Both will probably happen in the IAIK seminar-room (so not the meeting-room); to be confirmed.

**IMPORTANT:**
All our meetings are open to everyone, so if you are not part of LosFuzzys, feel free to come anyway. And if you know some people interested in what we do, please invite them. :-)
