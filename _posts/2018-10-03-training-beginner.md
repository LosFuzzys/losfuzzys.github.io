First meeting in this years' winter term!

- Are you new to Uni?
- Heard from us at the TU Welcome days?
- Interested in hacking and information security?

If so, this is the perfect training to get to know LosFuzzys!

* **When?** Wednesday (03. October), 18:15
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG064 (FuzzyLab, ground floor)
* **Who?** you!

What will we do:

- Very short introduction of our team.
  - Who are we, what do we do?
  - What is a CTF anyway?
- Present some simple challenges for you.
  - If you already know this kind of stuff and are more advanced, we also have harder challenges ;)
- Open session in the end for questions and general talk


PS: If you have any question(s), don't hesitate to ask, just drop a mail at:  we -at- hack.more.systems
