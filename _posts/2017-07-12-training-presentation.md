Last meeting before the summer break?

* **When?** Wednesday (12. July), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)
* 
*gast04* will present his Bachelors thesis! It's about a plugin (*r4ge*) for Radare [1] applying symbolic execution.

Afterwards *gast04* will give a live demo of his plugin and debugging with Radare. For that he also prepared challenges, on which we can then apply the gathered knowledge.

So `git pull` your Radare & C Yu on Wednesday! (;

PS: If you have any question(s), don't hesitate to ask.
