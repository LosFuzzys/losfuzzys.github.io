Our regular beginner trainings are coming to an end. This week we neither
have an introduction talk, nor do we release new challenges. 

You are welcome to hack on either prior challenges or challenges from other online CTFs, like our [Fuzzy Land](https://fuzzy.land), the beginner-friendly [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/), and legendary [LSE](https://ctf.lse.epita.fr/).

* **When?** Wednesday (31. October), 18:15 ~ 21:00
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (seminar room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (bring a laptop) Please add your nickname here, so we can allocate enough space: https://doodle.com/poll/rdqnhq6dwaqz53ic


See you there!
