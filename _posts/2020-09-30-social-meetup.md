* **Who?** You! [Please doodle.](https://doodle.com/poll/v6p5tefetz6zh9zb)

Yet another semester is about to start and we hope you all had a good summer. 
Since we did not see each other very often, we would like to invite everyone to come **hang out with us** on Wednesday. 
Whether you have never been to LosFuzzys or you are a seasoned CTF player, *everyone is welcome to join us*.

Because of the current situation with Corona we will meet in [the park between Inffeldgasse and Spar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B003'32.3%22N+15%C2%B027'19.7%22E/@47.058983,15.4549338,199m).
So let's hope the weather is nice -- *fingers crossed*

As always, if you have any questions, please contact us. :)
