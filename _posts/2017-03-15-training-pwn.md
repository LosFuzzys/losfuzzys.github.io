As usual we're meeting this Wednesday.

* **When?** Wednesday (15. March), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)

*creed* will prepare an interesting pwn/reverse challenge.


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational Matters (BSides, LosCTF, next CTFs, ...)
1. pwn/reverse with *creed*
2. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
