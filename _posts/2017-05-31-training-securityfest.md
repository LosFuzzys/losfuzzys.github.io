As usual we're meeting this Wednesday for a training session.

* **When?** Wednesday (31. May), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)

During our training session 2 weeks ago, we had a look at upcoming CTFs in which we want to participate. Since regularly participating in CTFs is as important as training regularly, this Wednesday we will use our training session to participate in the CTF event **Security Fest 2017**.
