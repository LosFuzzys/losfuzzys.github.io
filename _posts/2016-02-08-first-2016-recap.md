A lot happened since our last meetup:

* 32C3 CTF
* First training sessions
* Insomni'hack teaser
* HackIM
* EFF CTF
* Sharif University CTF

Since we are currently on "Lehrveranstaltungsfreie Zeit", we propose a meetup to recap those CTFs, discuss insights/learnings/tools, and maybe recap/walkthrough some challenges. The meetup will probably happen at IAIK again (Inffeldgasse 16a, ground floor).

Also a good starting point for those new to CTF!
